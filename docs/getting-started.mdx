# Getting Started

### Theming

Everblue provides a set of pre-styled, polished React components that are ready to use out the box. However, when tasked with building modern web applications \n
nowadays, the idea of consitency throughout your app's UI is essential. In light of this we have adopted the `styled-system` theming engine - which makes this a breeze.

Please have a look through the `styled-system` docs for more detailed info on the API, but to get set up simply follow the steps below:

#### 1. Create a Theme

In `src` folder of your project, create a new Themes folder.

In here create a theme file, for the sake of this example we will call it `theme.js`.

You can now customize your theme to suit your requirements, as a reference point you should end up with something like this:

```
export default theme = {
  fontSizes: [14, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128],
  space: [0, 5, 10, 20, 40, 60],
  fontFamily: "Hind",
  colors: {
    blue: "#3578EA",
    error: "rgba(200, 0, 0, 0.8)",
    success: "#16a085",
    white: "#FFFFFF",
    offWhite: "#f9f9f9",
    grayExtraLight: "#EEF1F5",
    semiBlack: "#313131eb",
    grayLight: "#CED4DE",
    gray: "#7D899C",
    grayDark: "#2D3747",
    grayExtraDark: "#1D2330",
    dark: "#13161F",
    skyBlue: "#1FB6FF"
  }
};
```

#### 2. Reference your theme using ThemeProvider

Once you've created your theme, you need to allow your app to access these values. This is done via `styled-components`' `ThemeProvider` component.

If using `create-react-app`, edit your `index.js` file so it resembles the following:

```
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import { ThemeProvider } from "styled-components";

import "./index.css";
import App from "./App";
import { theme } from "./Themes";
import registerServiceWorker from "./registerServiceWorker";

ReactDOM.render(
  <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
    <App />
  </ThemeProvider>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
registerServiceWorker();
```
